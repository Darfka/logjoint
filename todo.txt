should have:
IntelliTrace
NLog support:
  http://nlog.codeplex.com/releases/view/32601
live logs backed up by temp file:
- input filters
- live plain file 
- windows event log
- listen to ports
Windows Event Log XML
log4net import: import textfile encoding (<!-- <encoding value="unicodeFFFE" /> -->)
log4net import: parse footer and header

the way to produce more than one message or to produce no messages
show original log button
xsd for xml configs + validation on read
bug: native writer is buggy: doesn't write some elements
bug: search for a phrase in a mutultline message. Wrong area is highlighted.
bug: sticking: hscroll to right -> glitch with drawing of the last line
bug: there are colors that cannot be distiguished on LCD monitors
regex-based format editor: add support for extensions
listen to the protocol as Insight does
procmon logs: convert binary format to XML on the fly
autodetect format by trying all the possible sources
time: show delta
generalize live logs: flush them to the file
ETW: investigate the problem about unregistered source
Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.EtwTraceListener
support for System.Diagnostics.DelimitedListTraceListener
tool to merge logs (or maybe save merged log as?)
select logs to reopen (dialog with checklist)
code: good logging (sources tree, message hashes as hex)
code: good comments
MSI logs
filesets
wordwrap, multiline lines
code: param checks
log4net: add support for method ENTER/EXIT
icon
LogJointWriter: use own FileWriter to support rewriting
think over: how to handle when the date of log is in heade	r, each emtry has time offset (win updates logs, filemon)
navigation history
go to frame end -> don't select the last line if not found 
stability with regexps that can match empty strings
ShiftDown()/Up() check if InternalUpdate is needed
optimize shifting
time constrain violation:
  - warn user about time constrain violation when opening a log file
  - eleminate little violations by using caching reader that would sort the messages in memory
return null from field expression to avoid handling
"message details" display icon next to the severity string
investigate:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa751795.aspx
glue to bookmarks on timeline
rotate logs
separate view (as in VS)
process mask symbols (?, *) in file names when creating log sources
unify file selection (single line like for XML, or multiline like for ETW)
investigate: Windows software trace preprocessor
named bookmarks
last items on top
EWT live logs
show errors/warnings on timeline for loaded lines. Show it if the density is small enough.
search history
search for hidden bookmarks: show threads/sources
join with performance logs

f-secure:
fs: parse obfustcated orsp logs
fsdiag
%ALLUSERS%\F-Secure\Logs\...
enable logging from the tool
